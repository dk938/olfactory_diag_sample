Even under pressure, your thought remains little affected and you know your limits. Contrasting with the calm appearance of your demeanor, your sense of humor is also attractive.\n\nOn the other hand, you may sometimes have difficulty understanding the emotions of others. Some may be aware of their weak emotional expressiveness. Consequently, you may tend to avoid social interactions and feel anxiety in communication.\n\nFurthermore, you may find it difficult to work in a team, which can make cooperation with others complicated. Sometimes, you may give a cold impression to others and feel uncomfortable in expressing affection.\n\nYou tend to think about things from a unique perspective, prioritizing reason over emotions, and trying to grasp things from an original angle.",
